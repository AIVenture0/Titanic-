<b align='center'> Titanic(One of the most popular kaggle competition for the ML Beginners)</b>

The most famous competition over the kaggle .
In this Repository my intention is to basically explain to every beginner but how to begin with Kaggle very first time. So this repository is for those who just begin their __Machine Learning Journey__. In this notebook i try to take down every single topic with a very naive approach so every beginner can grasp it very easily.

```Let's Begin```

## Competition Description

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## Overview
Code in the repo is for the one who just begin with kaggle's Titanic competition.This basically explains all the basic concept ,
How to approach the any competition over kaggle and how to start with it.

## Dependencies 

- Python3
- Numpy 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Supervised Learning
- Machine Learning Algorithm
- Classification Algorithms

## Usage
Run this using [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Just type `jupyter notebook` in the main directory and the code will pop up in a browser window. 

## Result
The output of the code is to predict the survival(0-Die,1-Survive) of the passenger who borded on the Titanic.
